# SCI-SEQ-Meiotic-drive (WIP)
#### Iskander Said -- Barbash Lab -- Clark lab -- Cornell University 2019
Repository of Python scripts and analysis tools necessary for the analysis and simulation of single cell sequencing data for meiotic drive detection.

# Introduction

The following project revolves around leveraging low coverage single cell sequencing platforms, like SCI-ATAC-SEQ to detect segregation distortion in a backcrossed population of Drosophila melanogaster. The logic behind using single cell data rather than pooled sequencing is that it allows us to normalize cells by the amount of DNA that they contribute. This means that we can use the genotypes of the cells to make it such that each individual only contributes one genotype.
