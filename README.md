# SCI-SEQ-Meiotic-drive
#### Iskander Said -- Barbash Lab -- Cornell University 2019
Repository of Python scripts and analysis tools necessary for the analysis and simulation of single cell sequencing data for meiotic drive detection.

# Premise

The premise of this analysis is to develop a method for detecting segregation distortion using single cell genomics data.

# Scripts:
The Jupyter notebooks contains detailed information on my logic and troubleshooting when conceptualizing this analysis.

The Python scripts are the standalone final products for the generation of simulations and for the downstream analysis of the simulated and real data.
