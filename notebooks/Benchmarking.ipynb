    "I want to express the capabilities and limitations of my statistical method in relationship to SNP density and the recombination rate. These two factors will play in greatly into how well I am able to cluster individuals and classify with my HMM. In order to do this I am going to have to come up with some kind of a scheme to simulate data at different recombination rates and different SNP sub sampling. "
